      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        In Memorial was conceived from a deeply personal experience with loss by
        founders Ben Pelta and Behzad Qazi. When Ben faced the passing of a
        cherished family member, he found solace in crafting a digital tribute
        filled with photos, stories, and treasured moments. This act not only
        aided in processing grief but also brought his family closer together.
        <br /><br />Recognizing the disconnection between digital memorials and
        the physical world, Ben and his friends envisioned a solution: linking
        QR codes to digital tributes for instant access at gravesites, homes,
        and memorial altars. This idea sparked the creation of In Memorial, a
        company dedicated to blending technology with compassion to create
        meaningful tributes.
